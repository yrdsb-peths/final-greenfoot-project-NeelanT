# Final Greenfoot Project: Tank Trouble 3

#### About the game
My program is a game that is the spiritual successor to popular hit flash games Tank Trouble 1 and 2. 

There are 2 players in the game, the blue tank and the red tank, using W A S D and Arrow keys to move and spacebar and shift to shoot respectively. The idea of the game is that the bullets shot bounce off walls and can destroy both the shooter's tank and the enemy tank.

#### Getting Started
To get started, press space at the title screen and use the controls mentioned previously to play, first to 10 points wins the round.
